Overall design
--------------
- As less new error codes as possible.
  Whereever possible, use PF error codes as long as
  they make sense.
- As less malloc-free / new-delete as possible.
  Wherever possible, objects are allocated on the stack.


Key Data Structures
-------------------
- RM_Page and free list
  RM_Page is laid out in memory as following

  | next_free_page_number |
  | number_of_records     |
  | b0 ....           b32 | \
  | b33 ....          b64 | bitmap
  |          ...          | /
  |  records              |

- Bitmap
  A bitmap is defined in bitmap.h and implemented in bitmap.cc


Testing
-------
- Set up gtest framework for unit tsting
- tests in /test directory
- Tested with tests found in the common-tests class
  directory too.


Known Bugs
----------
- Segmentation fault on rm_testkpg
  still debugging! :(
