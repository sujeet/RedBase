Overall design
--------------
- This part has been more about consumption
  of earlier-designed APIs rather than designing new ones.
- My RM component submission was quite incomplete,
  for this part, I re-wrote the RM component from scratch.
- Both RM and IX components were designed keeping
  ease-of-use of the API in mind. That greatly simplified
  writing code for SM part.


Difficulties / challenges
-------------------------
- The way I designed the RM component, new pages are
  added at the beginning of the list and not at the end.
  That results in unusual iteration order while scanning.
  For example, say, 4 records fit in one page.
  insertion order: 1 2 3 4 5 6
  scanning order : 5 6 1 2 3 4
  this caused a few tests to fail in the test suite.
  For those cases, I manually checked the output sorting,
  it with bash-script and making sure that it is correct.
- This was the first time there was an absolute need to
  be able to distinguish between warnings and errors
  (+ve error code and -ve error code)
  in my exception-based setup I achieved the same by
  providing two classes: exception and warning.


Testing
-------
- As I implemented RM from scratch, I added tests for RM
  to the Google test framework I set up.
- As SM part was more about interacting with an interpreter,
  and hardly about the API, I manually tested using the REPL.
- In addition, I used the tests in the shared folder under
  class directory.
